## Differences Between Paper and Artifact ##

- Our formalization only has two base types: nat and bool,
- Our formalization only have four operators: `+`, `==`, `<`, `nat_gen`. Other operators shown in the paper can be implemented in terms of these. E.g., the minus operator can be defined as:

```
let minus (x: nat) (y: nat) =
    let (diff: nat) = nat_gen () in
    if x + diff == y then diff else err
```

In addition, to simplify the syntax, all operators take two input arguments; e.g., the random nat generator takes two arbitrary numbers as input.
- In the formalization, to simplify the syntax, pattern-matching can only pattern match against Boolean variables. Pattern matching over natural numbers

```
match n with
| 0 -> e1
| S n' -> e2
```

is implemented as follows:

```
if n == 0 then e1
else let n' = n - 1 in e2
```

- We assume all input programs are alpha-converted, such that all variables have unique names.
- The substitution of refinement types are formalized into a state, helping to eliminate termination checks of the fixpoint function in Coq when we define the logical relation.
- In the formalization, our coverage typing rules additionally require that the all branches of a pattern matching expression are type safe in the basic type system (they may not be consistent with the coverage type we want to check).  This restriction helps guarantee that a program with coverage types is type safe under a basic type system.

## Axioms ##

Our formalization assumes the functional and propositional extensionality axioms (`FunctionalExtensionality` and `PropExtensionality`) in order to reason about equality of refinement types (we encode qualifiers as Coq propositions `Prop`). We also rely on the following assumptions, all of which are axioms in the file `Ax.v`.
- Renaming assumptions related to binding and duplication.
- Programs always halt. We assume there exists a well-founded relation over all constants, used in the `decreases` check of the typing rule of the fix-point function; if a term can reduce to a value, then they have the same basic type (this is implied by the preservation property for halting programs)
- Some syntactic equivalence facts of our core language, for example `let x = e_x in x` is equal to `e_x`.
